Right so this is the first tutorial I'm writing using a project I've written using Hart - which allows me to embed source. This project can be cloned down and all examples can be run / hacked around with.

So bear with me. This is probably going to be a work in progress until I figure things out. The cool thing about this though, is I can checkout the repo at this 'state' and modify whatever is needed, and then do a git rebase and yeah.
